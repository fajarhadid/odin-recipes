    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken adobo is a delicious tangy, savoury Filipino chicken dish. 
    The tender chicken is cooked in a soy vinegar sauce with aromatics and I love serving it over steamed rice with veggies. 
    The dish originates from the Philippines. The word "adobo" is derived from the Spanish word "adobar", which means "marinade" or "sauce" in English.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li><br>
        <li>> 1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li><br>
        <li>> 1 large onion, quartered and sliced</li><br>
        <li>> 2 tablespoons minced garlic</li><br>
        <li>> ⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce</li><br>
        <li>> ⅓ cup white vinegar</li><br>
        <li>> 1 tablespoon garlic powder</li><br>
        <li>> 2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
        <li>> 1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
        Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside. </li><br>
        <li>2. Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 6 minutes. </li><br>
        <li>3. Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf. </li><br>
        <li>4. Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. 
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</li><br>
