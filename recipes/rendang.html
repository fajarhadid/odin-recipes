    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Rendang is a dish which originated from the Minangkabau ethnic group of Indonesia and now commonly served across the country. 
    Rendang is one of the famous dish among 30 Indonesian Culinary Icons. Rendang is made from beef (or occasionally chicken, mutton, water buffalo, duck, 
    or vegetables like jackfruit or cassava) slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices for several hours until almost all the liquid is gone, 
    allowing the meat to absorb the spicy condiments. The cooking process changes from boiling to frying as the liquid evaporates. 
    The slow cooking process allows the meat to absorb all the spices and to become tender. The spices may include ginger, galangal, turmeric leaf, 
    lemon grass and chillies. Chicken or duck rendang also contains tamarind and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.</p>
